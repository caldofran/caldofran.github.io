## Jobandtalent

_**December 2015 - Present**_

My main goal at [Jobandtalent](https://jobandtalent.com/) is to maintain and add new features to the mobile applications. I spend most of my time working on the iOS application but also contributing to the Android app when needed.

Although I am very focused on the product side, I also help the iOS Core team to improve the platform infrastructure and tooling.

My tasks are not only mobile-centered but I also develop new features on the backend side.

## Independent contractor

_**February 2015 - December 2015**_

For some time, I was working independently as an iOS developer for different clients.

Concretely, I help to the [Agile Monkeys](https://www.theagilemonkeys.com/) to build a clothing shopping app for the [Dolls Kill brand](https://www.dollskill.com/)

Besides, I developed an enterprise app for Visa, Inc. called Visa Card Lab. The main challenge was to fulfill Visa security requirements.

## Critizen

_**July 2014 - January 2015**_

At [Next Chance Invest](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nextchance-invest/about/) I was the iOS Lead Developer in charge of the build process of the Critizen app.

My main responsibilities were defining the iOS app architecture, leading the development process as well as managing the iOS development team.

## Minube

_**October 2011 - July 2014**_

I've started my career as iOS developer at [Minube](https://www.minube.com/). I joined a small but very committed development team where I learned many things while developing several apps.

## Atos Research & Innovation

_**June 2008 - March 2011**_

I started my engineering career as part of the Security Lab, carrying out managerial and development tasks in several projects for the European Community.

# Side projects

[CaldoConf](https://github.com/caldofran/caldoconf-mobile)

I am using this small side project to learn Kotlin and Android development. Besides, I am trying a multiplatform development approach using [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/) to share logic between the Android and the iOS app.
