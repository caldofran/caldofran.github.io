## Jobandtalent

_**December 2015 - Present**_

My main goal at Jobandtalent is to mantain and add new features to the mobile applications. Most of my time, I work on the iOS platform but the Android team lets me contribute to the Android app from time to time.

I don't only add new features but also help to the iOS Core team to improve the platform infraestructure and tooling.

I also create new endpoints for the mobile BFF (backend for frontend) implemented using Phoenix and Elixir.

# Side projects

[CaldoConf](https://github.com/caldofran/caldoconf-mobile)

I am using this small side project to learn Kotlin and Android development. In addition, I am trying a multiplaform development approach using [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/) to share logic between the Android and the iOS app.
