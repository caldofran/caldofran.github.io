## Jobandtalent

_**December 2015 - Present**_

My main responsibility at [Jobandtalent](https://jobandtalent.com/) is to build new features and improve the product by working in different functional squats. Despite my focus is on the iOS application I am involved in the whole product definition and implementation lifecycle. This could even include developing features on the backend side and contribute to the Android application.

Furthermore, I help the iOS guild to improve the platform infrastructure and tooling.

## Agile Monkeys

_**June 2015 - December 2015**_

I help to the [Agile Monkeys](https://www.theagilemonkeys.com/) to build a clothing shopping app for the [Dolls Kill](https://www.dollskill.com/) brand. The main challenge of this project was to work with the already existing legacy code of the app.

## Visa Inc.

_**February 2015 - June 2015**_

I developed an enterprise app called Visa Card Lab used by the Visa sales department to present different card designs to business costumers. The main challenge was to fulfill Visa security requirements.

## Next Chance Invest

_**July 2014 - January 2015**_

At [Next Chance Invest](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nextchance-invest/about/) I was the iOS Lead Developer of a small team in charge of the development process of the Critizen app. My main responsibilities were defining the iOS app architecture, leading the development process as well as managing the iOS development team.

## Minube

_**October 2011 - July 2014**_

I've started my career as iOS developer at [Minube](https://www.minube.com/). I joined a small but very committed development team in charge of developing the iOS applications of this traveling social network company.

Concretely, the Minube app was an application which not only gave access to the whole content of the social network but also added new features only possible on mobile devices.

Besides, we developed Minube guides, a white brand travel guide application that could be customized depending on the travel destinations or customer needs.

## Atos Research & Innovation

_**June 2008 - March 2011**_
